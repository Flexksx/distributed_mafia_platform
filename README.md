## Technologies and Communication Patterns

### Team Language Distribution
Our team implements services using **3 different programming languages** to leverage the strengths of each technology stack:

- **Java + Spring Boot**: Town Service, Character Service (our implementation)
- **Python + FastAPI**: Shop Service (team member implementation)
- **Node.js + Express**: User Management Service (team member implementation)

### Service Technologies

#### Town Service
- **Language**: Java 17
- **Framework**: Spring Boot 3.2 with Spring WebFlux
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15 with spatial extensions
- **Caching**: Redis for location state caching
- **Additional Libraries**: 
  - Spring Data JPA for database operations
  - Spring WebSocket for real-time movement tracking
  - Jackson for JSON serialization
  - Micrometer for metrics

**Technology Justification for Mafia Platform Business Case**:
- **Concurrency Excellence**: Java's virtual threads (Project Loom) and Spring WebFlux enable handling thousands of simultaneous player movements without performance degradation - critical for a multiplayer mafia game where real-time location tracking is essential
- **Enterprise Reliability**: Spring Boot's production-ready features (health checks, metrics, security) ensure the Town Service can handle the high-stakes nature of mafia gameplay where system downtime could disrupt active games
- **Spatial Data Processing**: PostgreSQL's PostGIS extension combined with Java's robust geospatial libraries enable complex location-based queries needed for territory control and proximity-based game mechanics
- **Transaction Safety**: Java's strong typing and Spring's transaction management ensure movement logs are never corrupted, maintaining game integrity for investigations and alibis
- **Ecosystem Maturity**: Extensive security libraries available for implementing the secretive, authenticated nature of mafia platform communications

#### Character Service  
- **Language**: Java 17
- **Framework**: Spring Boot 3.2 with Spring MVC
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15 for structured data, Redis for character state caching
- **Additional Libraries**:
  - Spring Data JPA with JSON support
  - Spring Cache abstraction
  - Bean Validation for data integrity
  - MapStruct for DTO mapping

**Technology Justification for Mafia Platform Business Case**:
- **Data Consistency**: Java's strong typing system and Spring's transaction management ensure inventory operations are atomic - when a character purchases disguise items, the transaction either completes entirely or fails entirely, preventing inventory corruption that could compromise gameplay
- **Complex Object Modeling**: Java's OOP capabilities excel at modeling the intricate character customization system where items have effects, restrictions, and relationships - essential for a mafia game where appearance and equipment directly impact gameplay mechanics
- **Secure State Management**: Spring Security integration enables role-based character access (family boss vs. street thug) with different customization privileges and inventory restrictions
- **Performance Optimization**: Redis integration provides sub-millisecond character state retrieval, crucial when multiple services need to validate character abilities during fast-paced mafia operations
- **JSON Flexibility**: PostgreSQL's JSON support combined with Jackson allows storing flexible character appearance data while maintaining query performance for complex inventory searches

### Communication Patterns

#### Synchronous Communication
- **REST APIs**: Primary communication method between all services
  - **Protocol**: HTTP/HTTPS with JSON payloads
  - **Authentication**: JWT tokens for secure inter-service communication
  - **Rate Limiting**: Implemented to prevent service abuse during high-intensity mafia operations
  - **Circuit Breaker**: Hystrix pattern to handle service failures gracefully

**Business Case Alignment**: REST ensures immediate response for critical operations like location access validation and inventory verification during time-sensitive mafia activities.

#### Asynchronous Communication
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: 
  - **Technology**: Apache Kafka for event streaming
  - **Pattern**: Publish-Subscribe for movement events and inventory changes
  - **Event Store**: Persistent event log for game activity auditing
- **Message Queuing**: 
  - **Technology**: RabbitMQ for reliable message delivery
  - **Use Cases**: Delayed notifications, batch inventory processing, activity reporting to Task Service

**Business Case Alignment**: Async patterns enable the platform to handle the secretive nature of mafia operations - events can be processed without blocking other operations, and the event store provides an immutable audit trail for investigations.

#### Real-Time Communication
- **WebSockets**: 
  - **Implementation**: Spring WebSocket with STOMP protocol
  - **Use Cases**: Live location updates, real-time character appearance changes during meetings
  - **Fallback**: Server-Sent Events (SSE) for browsers with limited WebSocket support

**Business Case Alignment**: Real-time updates are crucial for mafia gameplay where knowing who's where and what they're wearing can be life-or-death information.

### Trade-offs Analysis

#### Performance vs Complexity
- **Decision**: Multi-pattern communication (REST + Events + WebSockets)
- **Trade-off**: Increased system complexity for superior user experience
- **Business Impact**: Enhanced gameplay immersion justifies the architectural overhead - mafia games require seamless real-time interactions

#### Consistency vs Availability  
- **Decision**: Strong consistency for inventory, eventual consistency for location tracking
- **Trade-off**: Some location updates may have slight delays vs guaranteed inventory accuracy
- **Business Impact**: Financial transactions (shop purchases) require absolute accuracy, while location tracking can tolerate minor delays

#### Java Ecosystem vs Polyglot Architecture
- **Decision**: Java for both our services despite having Python/Node.js options
- **Trade-off**: Miss some language-specific benefits vs consistent development experience
- **Business Impact**: Faster development and easier maintenance outweigh potential performance gains from language optimization

#### Horizontal Scaling Considerations
- **Stateless Design**: Both services designed to be horizontally scalable
- **Database Partitioning**: Character data partitioned by game instance, location data by geographical regions
- **Cache Distribution**: Redis cluster setup for handling high-concurrency character state access
- **Load Balancing**: Spring Cloud Gateway for intelligent request routing based on user location and character activity patterns

### Security Architecture
Given the "high-risk, high-reward" nature of the Mafia Platform:

- **End-to-End Encryption**: All inter-service communication encrypted with TLS 1.3
- **Zero-Trust Model**: Every service call authenticated and authorized
- **Audit Logging**: Complete activity trails for forensic analysis
- **Data Anonymization**: Personal data encrypted at rest with rotating keys
- **Rate Limiting**: Aggressive throttling to prevent reconnaissance attacks on the platform

This technology stack provides the reliability, security, and performance needed for a clandestine gaming platform where system failures or data breaches could have serious consequences for the fictional "organization" and its members.
